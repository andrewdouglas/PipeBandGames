# PipeBandGames

Scottish bagpipe and drumming competitions/games require a lot of organization. This small application contains some helpful utilities to automate time-consuming tasks required in the organization of these games. The goals of the project are as follows:

1.  Automate time-consuming manual work for games organizers
2.  Practice/teach software development best practices

### Environment Setup

This code was created using Visual Studio 2017 Community and is set to compile against the .NET Core 1.1 Framework. Database access is via EntityFrameworkCore with a Sqlite database (the assumption is that an integrated database will be the cheapest option).

More to come later...
